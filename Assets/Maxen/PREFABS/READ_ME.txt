Make sure the any colliders in the level are on the "Level" layer. Make sure that the player (or anything else that can jump on enemies heads) is tagged with "CanBoop" (or you can create a new tag that has "CanBoop" somewhere in it, I.E. "Player, CanBoop")

If you want to change the enemies movement speed, or their initial move direction, have a look at the Horizontal Mover component on them.
